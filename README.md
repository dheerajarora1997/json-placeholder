# Json Placeholder Repository

Static / Dummy Json for project api handling. This is a small implementation of the same logic that was used to generate an Front-End app.

A static json file is a json file that contains data that does not change over time. A static json file is useful if you want to share some information about your application with someone else without having to send them a link to download the application.
